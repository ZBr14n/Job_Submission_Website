# Job_Submission_Website


# What is this?
- This is a job submission application to practice form processing in PHP.

### 10/20/2020:
~~### This app is still under development, I still need to work out how the data should be sanitize before submitting it to the database.~~
I am able to submit the resume file attachment as well as other info to the database without any errors.


### Features to add:
- I plan to use PHPWorrd or PDF Parser to pull data from file attachments and be able to parse and populate resume data for the user.
